# Underground-Route-Planner

My solution to the task:
Your team have been asked to provide a model software solution for a route planner of the London Underground tube system for use by the general public. You should provide a model that will determine the solution for the quickest journey time and you should carefully consider the design, implementation and testing of the software.
For a user of the underground system, your solution needs to provide 
1.   the functionality to quickly and efficiently elicit the information from the customer for a planned route
2.   provide a list of stations showing how the customer will travel from one starting station (x) to the destination station (y) on the underground system
3.   how long the journey will take in total
